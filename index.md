## What's [#PasswordNight]?

Welcome to [#PasswordNight]

This is a chance to take some time and improve your personal online security, learning along the way. [#PasswordNight] is an informal get together of people in the same boat of never finding the time for this stuff.

> I’ve been creating online accounts since I was in early teens. Some of them are still “active” or at least existing.
> Time to time I remember them and think about that password I reused a bunch of times in 2010 and never changed.
> I know these things are bad, but I never really set aside the time to fix that.
> That's why I'm doing a [#PasswordNight].
